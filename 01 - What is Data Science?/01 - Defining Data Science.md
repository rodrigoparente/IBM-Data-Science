# What is Data Science?

What is Data Science according specialists:

- Data Science is a process, not an event. It is the process of using data to understand different things,
to understand the world;
- For me is when you have a model or hypothesis of a problem, and you try to validate that hypothesis or model with your data;
- Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data;
- It's when you translate data into a story. So use storytelling to generate insight. And with these insights, you can make strategic choices for a company or an institution.

In summary, Data Science is the study of data, and it is relevant nowadays because we have tons of data available. We used to worry about lack of data. Now we have a data deluge. In the past, we didn't have algorithms, now we have algorithms. In the past, the software was expensive, now it's open source and free. In the past, we couldn't store large amounts of data, now for a fraction of the cost, we can have gazillions of datasets for a very low cost. So, the tools to work with data, the very availability of data, and the ability to store and analyze data, it's all cheap, it's all available, it's all ubiquitous, it's here. There's never been a better time to be a data scientist. 

# Fundamentals of Data Science

Data scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. 

## What is the process of Data Science?

1. clarify the business need
    - What is the question that the organization wants answered?
2. Prepare the data
    - What data do we need to solve the problem?
    - Where will that data come from?
2. Use a model to explore the data
    - unstructured data
    - structured data
3. Reveal Insights and communicating the results
    - understand the nature of the problem
    - recommend actions to be taken

# Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century

Ten years ago, Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil published an article in the Harvard Business Magazine saying that being a data scientist was the ["The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"](https://hbr.org/2022/07/is-data-scientist-still-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). A decade later, The job has grown in popularity and is generally well-paid, and the field is projected to experience more growth than almost any other by 2029. But the job has changed, in both large and small ways. 

# The Many Paths to Data Science

As data science is not a discipline traditionally taught at universities, contemporary data scientists come from diverse backgrounds such as engineering, mathematics, and even psychology. The secret skill is passion for continuous learning of new tools and patience to clean and analyze data.

# Advice for New Data Scientists

Data scientist need to be: 
 - Curious: curiosity helps you explore data and come up with meaningful questions;
 - Argumentative: good, sound, reasonable arguments help you explain your findings after learning from the data,
compelling the listener to adjust their ideas based on the new information;
- Judgmental: good judgment guides you to start in the right direction.

# Summary

In this lesson, you have learned:

- Data science is the study of data to understand the world. And art of uncovering insights and trends;
- Data scientists translate the data into stories to generate insights, these insights aid strategic decision-making for companies or institutions;
- The process of gleaning insights from data includes clarifying the problem, data collection, analysis, pattern recognition, storytelling, and visualization;
- The background of Data Scientits can come from various fields like economics, engineering, medicine, and more;
- Companies are looking for versatile individuals who know a lot about a particular subject, have some experience in programming and analyzing data, and can communicate well.

# Glossary

| Term       | Definition |
|------------|------------|
| Algorithms | A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or complete a task. |
| Models     | A representation of the relationships and patterns found in data to make predictions or analyze complex systems retaining essential elements needed for analysis. |
| Outliers   | When a data point or points occur significantly outside of most of the other data in a data set, potentially indicating anomalies, errors, or unique phenomena that could impact statistical analysis or modeling. |
| Quantitative analysis | A systematic approach using mathematical and statistical analysis is used to interpret numerical data. |
| Structured data | Data is organized and formatted into a predictable schema, usually related tables with rows and columns. |
| Unstructured data | Unorganized data that lacks a predefined data model or organization makes it harder to analyze using traditional methods. This data type often includes text, images, videos, and other content that doesn't fit neatly into rows and columns like structured data. |
