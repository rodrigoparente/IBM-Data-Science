# A Day in the Life of a Data Scientist

 - build recommendation engines as part of a large organization;
 - make predictions using artificial neural networks;
 - analyze huge amounts of structured and unstructured data to generate insights.

# Data Science Skills & Big Data

Aspiring data scientists, need to learn many tools such as Python, UNIX commands, pandas, and Jupyter notebook. Big Data also plays an important role, as its primary role is to collect and store this massive amount of information efficiently. Data which can be analyzed using Data Science.

# Understanding Different Types of File Formats

Standard file formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| .csv   | text files are text files used to store data as text in which each line, or row, has values separated by a delimiter;where a delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters for specifying the boundary between independent entities or values |
| .xlsx  | file format that falls under the spreadsheet file format created by Microsoft | 
| .xml   | is a markup language with set rules for encoding data that is both readable by humans and machines
| .pdf   | is a file format developed by Adobe to present documents independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems, which means it can be viewed the same way on any device |
| .json  | is a text-based open standard designed for transmitting structured data over the web |

# Data Science Topics and Algorithms

 - **Regression:** is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion;
 - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** are models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in animal brains. An ANN consists of connected nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a brain. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in a brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons;
 - **Data Visualization:** is the practice of designing and creating easy-to-communicate and easy-to-understand graphic or visual representations of a large amount of complex quantitative and qualitative data and information with the help of static, dynamic or interactive visual items. 

> Using complicated machine learning algorithms does not always guarantee achieving a better performance. Occasionally, a simple algorithm such as k-nearest neighbor can yield a satisfactory performance comparable to the one achieved using a complicated algorithm. It all depends on the data.

# What Makes Someone a Data Scientist?

*Murtaza Haider*, author of the book "Getting Started with Data Science", defines data scientist as someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing Big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders; and data science as something that data scientists do.

*Dr Patil*, Chief Data Scientist of the United States, told the Guardian newspaper in 2012 that a data scientist is that unique blend of skills that can both unlock the insights of data and tell a fantastic story via the data.

*Rachel Schutt*, the Chief Data Scientist at News Corp. and teacher of a data science course at Columbia University, defines data scientist as someone who is a part computer scientist, part software engineer, and part statistician. But that's the definition of an average data scientist. "The best", she contended, "tend to be really curious people, thinkers who ask good questions and are O.K. dealing with unstructured situations and trying to find structure in them".

# Summary

- Data scientist investigate and find explanations for many problems;
- Algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics are necessary educational backgrounds for data scientits;
- Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data.
