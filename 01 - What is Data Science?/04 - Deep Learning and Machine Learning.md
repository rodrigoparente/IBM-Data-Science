# Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

 - Big Data refers to data sets that are so massive, so quickly built, and so varied that they defy traditional analysis methods such as you might perform with a relational database;
 - Data Mining is the process of automatically searching and analyzing data, discovering previously unrevealed patterns;
 - Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it is learned without being explicitly programmed;
 - Artificial neural networks, often referred to simply as neural networks, are a collection of small computing units called neurons that take incoming data and learn to make decisions over time;
 - Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making;

 > **Data Science vs Artificial Intelligence (AI):** data science is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data. It's an interdisciplinary field involving mathematics, statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more. There is some interaction between AI and Data Science, but one is not a subset of the other. Rather, Data Science is a broad term that encompasses the entire data processing methodology while AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions. Both AI and Data Science can involve the use of big data.

# Generative AI and Data Science

 - Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on producing new data rather than just analyzing existing data;
 - It allows machines to create content, including images, music, language, computer code, and more, mimicking creations by people;
 - How does generative AI works?
    - Deep learning models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are at the foundation of this technique;
    - These models create new instances that replicate the underlying distribution of the original data by learning patterns from enormous volumes of data.
 - Generative AI has found diverse applications across various industries:
    - Natural language processing like OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 can generate human-like text, revolutionizing content creation and chatbots;
    - In healthcare, Generative AI can synthesize medical images, aiding in the training of medical professionals;
    - Generative AI can create unique and visually stunning artworks, generating endless creative visual compositions;
    - Game developers use Generative AI to generate realistic environments, characters, and game levels;
    - Data scientists can augment their data sets using generative AI to create synthetic data;
    - Generative AI can generate accurate business insights and comprehensive reports, making it possible to update these insights as the data evolves.

# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

 - Neural network is a computer program that tries to mimic how neurons works, and how our brains process things;
 - Those networks are computationally very intensive/expensive;
 - Deep Learning is neural networks on steroids and can be used to, for example, speech recognition, classifying images, etc;
 - To get started with neural networks, you need knowledge in linear algebra.

# Applications of Machine Learning

 - **Recommendation systems:** is a subclass of information filtering system that provides suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user;
 - **Classification systems:** is a system that tries to predict the correct label of a given input data;
 - **Cluster analysis:** is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups;
 - **Predictive analytics:** is a form of business analytics applying machine learning to generate a predictive model for certain business applications.

# Summary

 - AI Terminology: machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks;
 - Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used, for example, to make predictions or recommendations;
 - One of the techniques implemented by ML algorithms is regression.
