# How Should Companies Get Started in Data Science?

 - For businesses, if they are unable to measure something, they are unable to improve it;
 - So the first thing a company has to do is to start recording information, start capturing data;
 - Once you have data, then you can apply algorithms and analytics to it;
 - Data never gets old.

# Old Problems, New Data Science Solutions

 - Organizations can leverage the almost unlimited amount of data now available to them in a growing number of ways;
 - However, all organizations ultimately use data science for the same reasonâ€”to discover optimum solutions to existing problems;
 - Two examples of data science providing innovative solutions for old problems are:
    - In **transport**, Uber collects real-time user data to discover how many drivers are available, if more are needed, and if they should allow a surge charge to attract more drivers;
    - In **Environment**, a team of scientists is developing and deploying new algorithmic models to explore the growth of harmfull cyanobacteria in lakes across the east coast.

# Applications of Data Science

 - Data science and big data are making an undeniable impact on businesses, changing day to day operations, financial analytics, and especially interactions with customers;
 - In this era of big data, almost everyone generates masses of data every day, often without being aware of it;
 - This digital trace reveals the patterns of our online lives;
 - Some of the applications of Data Science are:
    - Recommendation systems;
    - Personal assistants.
 - Data science will fundamentally change the way businesses compete and operate.

# How Data Science is saving lives

*Healthcare*

 - In healthcare, data scientists use predictive analytics developed from data mining, data modeling, statistics, and machine learning to find the best options for patients;
 - This type of predictive analytics examines all known factors for a disease, including gene markers, associated conditions, and environmental factors.
- With this type of system, every physician has access to the same knowledge, and the best options can be consistently offered, improving patient outcomes;


*Disaster Preparedness*

 - In the field of *Disaster Preparedness*, the ability to save lives using Data Science tools has been under development for many years;
 - The use of predictive analytics tools is improving and providing new data analysis in a multitude of ways, alerting populations to danger faster than ever before;
 - Earthquakes, hurricanes & tornados, floods, and volcanic eruptions can be predicted with the help of data science.

# The Final Deliverable

 - The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or strategy;
 - Analytics summarize findings in tables and plots;
 - The data scientist should then use the insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings;
 - In academia, the final deliverable is in the form of essays and reports, usually with 1,000 to 7,000 words in length;
 - In consulting and business, the final deliverable can be a small document of fewer than 1,500 words illustrated with tables and plots, or it could be a comprehensive document comprising several hundred pages.

# Summary

 - Companies can start on their data science journey by capturing data. Once they have data, they can begin analysing it;
 - The purpose of the final deliverable of a Data Science project is to communicate new information and insights from the data analysis to key decision-makers.
