# How Can Someone Become a Data Scientist?

 - A real data scientist, the high-end data scientists, are mostly PhDs;
 - They often come out of physics, out of statistics, they have to have a computer science background, they have to have a math background, they have to know about databases and statistics and probability and all that stuff;
 - The skills that you need to know are:
    - How to program or at least have some computational thinking;
    - Algebra, at least up to analytics, geometry, and hopefully some calculus, basic probability, and statistics;
    - Understanding of computing databases;
    - Self-learning.

# Recruiting for Data Science

 - When the companies are hiring people for a data science team, maybe a data scientist or an analyst, the tendency would be to find the person who has all the skills, that they know the domain-specific knowledge;
 - They're excellent in analyzing structured and unstructured data. And they're great at presenting and they've got great storytelling skills;
 - So if you put all this together, you will realize you're looking for a unicorn. And your odds of finding a unicorn are pretty rare;
 - What you need to do to is to see, given the pool of applicants you have,
who has the most resonance with your firm's DNA.

# Careers in Data Science

It will continue growing, as organizations increasingly rely on data-driven insights.

# The Report Structure

 - Strutucture of a report:
    - Cover page;
    - Table of contents;
    - Executive summary;
    - Detailed contents; 
    - Acknowledgments;
    - References;
    - Appendices.
 - A clearly organized and logical report should communicate the following to the reader:
    - What they gain by reading the report;
    - Clearly defined goals;
    - The significance of your contribution;
    - Appropriate context by giving sufficient background;
    - Why this work is practical and useful;
    - Conjecture plausible future developments that might result from your work.

# Summary

 - Companies can start on their data science journey by capturing data. Once they have data, they can begin analyzing it;
 - The purpose of the final deliverable of a Data Science project is to communicate new information and insights from the data analysis to key decision-makers;
 - The report should present a thorough analysis of the data and communicate the project findings;
 - Companies should look for someone excited about working with the data in their particular industry;
