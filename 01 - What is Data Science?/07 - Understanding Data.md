# Understanding Data

 - Generally, data comprises of facts, observations, perceptions, numbers, characters, symbols, and images that can be interpreted to derive meaning;
 - One of the ways in which data can be categorized is by its structure:
    - **Structured data:** has a well-defined structure or adheres to a specified data model, can be stored in well-defined schemas such as databases, and in many cases can be represented in a tabular manner with rows and columns;
    - **Semi-structured data:** has some organizational properties but lacks a fixed or rigid schema. It contains tags and elements, or metadata, which is used to group data and organize it in a hierarchy;
    - **Unstructured data:** can deal with the heterogeneity of sources and has a variety of business intelligence and analytics applications. Can be stored in files and documents (such as a Word doc) for manual analysis or in NoSQL databases that have their own analysis tools for examining this type of data.

# Data Sources

 - **Relational Databases:** is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another;
 - **Flatfiles and XML Datasets:** store data in plain text format, with one record or row per line, and each value separated by delimiters such as commas, semi-colons, or tabs;
 - **APIs and Web Services:** typically listen for incoming requests, which can be in the form of web requests from users or network requests from applications, and return data in plain text, XML, HTML, JSON, or media files;
 - **Web Scraping:** is used to extract relevant data from unstructured sources, like web pages;
 - **Data Streams and Feeds:** are another widely used source for aggregating constant streams of data flowing from sources such as instruments, IoT devices, and applications, GPS data from cars, computer programs, etc.

# Metadata

 - Metadata is data that provides information about other data;
 - There are three main types of metadata:
    - **Technical metadata:** is metadata which defines the data structures in data repositories or platforms, primarily from a technical perspective;
    - **Process metadata:** describes the processes that operate behind business systems such as data warehouses, accounting systems, or customer relationship management tools;
    - **Business metadata:** is information about the data described in readily interpretable ways, such as, how the data is acquired, what the data is measuring or describing, and the connection between the data and other data sources.
 - Managing metadata includes developing and administering policies and processes to ensure information can be accessed and integrated from various sources and appropriately shared across the entire enterprise;
 - Well managed metadata helps you to understand both the business context associated with the enterprise data and the data lineage, which helps to improve data governance;

# Summary

 - Different data formats, such as, structured, unstructured, and semi-structured;
 - Multiple data sources, such as, relational databases, web scraping, and data streams;
 - Metadata and its three main types: technical, process, and business.
