1. What key benefit does cloud computing offer users, particularly in contrast to traditional software installations on their local computers?

- [ ] Cloud computing eliminates the need for users to store any data locally.
- [ ] Cloud computing requires users to purchase and install their own applications locally.
- [x] Users can access the latest version of applications without purchasing retail copies.
- [ ] Users have more control over their applications in the cloud.

**Correct**
Correct! One of the main benefits of cloud computing is allowing users to access the latest application versions without purchasing new copies.

2. What are the primary advantages of using cloud for data scientists?

- [ ] The Cloud allows data scientists to store data locally and use advanced computing algorithms.
- [ ] The Cloud can only be accessed from laptops, not tablets or phones.
- [x] The Cloud enables data scientists to work with large datasets and deploy advanced computing algorithms and tools available centrally.
- [ ] The Cloud offers up-to-date tools and libraries for data scientists but restricts access to specific time zones.

**Correct**
Correct! The passage highlights that the Cloud allows data scientists to work with large datasets, deploy advanced algorithms and tools centrally, and collaborate with multiple entities.

3. What are the common characteristics of Big Data, often called the "V's of Big Data"?

- [x] Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value
- [ ] Variety, Verification, and Value
- [ ] Volume, Vector, and Verification
- [ ] Vision, Velocity, and Visualization

**Correct**
Correct! The passage mentions the "V's of Big Data" as Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value.

4. How has the interest in data science and business analytics changed over the last few years, and what is the impact on undergraduate courses in this field?

- [x] Interest in data science and business analytics has increased, leading to a growing number of students enrolling in related undergraduate courses.
- [ ] Interest in data science has declined, leading to a decrease in enrollment in undergraduate courses.
- [ ] Interest in data science has remained constant, with no significant changes in enrollment in related undergraduate courses.
- [ ] Interest in data science has shifted primarily to parents rather than students.

**Correct**
Correct! The passage mentions that interest in data science has increased, resulting in more students enrolling in undergraduate courses related to data science and analytics.

5. Which open-source technology provides distributed storage and processing of big data, allowing scalability and support for various data formats?

- [x] Apache Hadoop
- [ ] NoSQL databases
- [ ] Apache Hive
- [ ] Apache Spark

**Correct**
Correct! Apache Hadoop is the technology described in the passage that provides distributed storage and processing for big data with scalability and support for various data formats.
