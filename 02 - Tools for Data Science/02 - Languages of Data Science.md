# Languages of Data Science

 - To select the language to learn, you first need to identify the problem you want to solve and who you are solving them for;
 - The problems can be related to the company you work for, what role you have, and the age of your existing application;
 - The recommend programming languages are Python, R, and SQL;
 - However, other languages such as Scala, Java, C++, and Julia with specific features are also popular.

# Introduction to Python

 - Python is is the most widely used and most popular programming language used in the data science industry;
 - According to the 2019 Kaggle Data Science and Machine Learning Survey, 3/4 of the over 10,000 respondents worldwide reported that they use Python regularly;
 - Glassdoor reported that in 2019 more than 75% of data science positions listed included Python in their job descriptions;
 - Python is useful in many areas including data science, AI and machine learning, and web development;
 - Large organizations that heavily use python include IBM, Wikipedia, Google,CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify, and Reddit;
 - For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib;
 - And for artificial intelligence, it has TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Scikit-learn.

# Introduction to R Language

 - R is an open-source language, which means it is free to use and can be modified by anyone;
 - It is widely used for its statistical techniques such as linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, and clustering;
 - R supports a wide range of data types and structures, including vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists, making it highly versatile for data manipulation.
 - R can produce high-quality static and interactive graphics, making it a popular choice for creating detailed plots and charts;
 - It has a large and active community of users and developers;
 - According to Kaggleâ€™s Data Science and Machine Learning survey, most programmers learn R after a few years into their data science career.

# Introduction to SQL Language

 - SQL provides commands to define and modify the structure of a database, which includes creating (`CREAT`), altering (`ALTER`), and dropping (`DROP`) tables and other database objects;
 - SQL allows you to manipulate data within the database, which includes inserting (`INSERT`), updating (`UPDATE`), deleting (`DELETE`), and retrieving (`SELECT`) data;
 - SQL is primarily used to query databases. It provides powerful commands to filter, sort, group, and join data from multiple tables;
 - SQL supports transaction processing, which ensures that either all operations are completed successfully, or none are, maintaining data integrity;
 - SQL includes features to enforce data integrity and security

# Other Languages for Data Science

**Java**

 - A general-purpose object-oriented programming language;
 - Hude adoption in the enterprise space, designed to be fast and scalable;
 - Applications are compiled to bytecode and run on JVM;
 - For data sciece, java tools are:
    - Weka, used in data mining;
    - Java-ML, which is a ML library;
    - Apache MLlib, that can be used to make ML scalable.

**Scala**

 - A general-purpose programming language that provides support for functional programming;
 - Designed as an extension to Java, it is interoperable with Java as it also runs on JVM;
 - The name Scala comes from "Scalable Language"
 - For data science, Apache Spark:
    - Provides APIs that make parallel jobs easy to write;
    - Optimized engine that supports computation graphs;
    - Designed to be faster than Hadoop

**C++**

 - A general-purpose langauge, an extension of C;
 - Improves processing speed, enables system programming, and gives users broader control over the application;
 - Developers programs that feed data to customers in real-time;
 - For data science, C++ applications are:
    - TensorFlow, which is a Deep Learning (DL) library;
    - MongoDB, a NoSQL database for data management;
    - Caffe, a DL algorithm repository.

**Julia**

 - Designed for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science;
 - Provides speedy development and fast programs;
 - Executes directly on the processor;
 - Calls C, Go, Java, MATLAB, R, and Python libraries with refined parallelism;
 - For data science, JuliaDB, a package for working with large persistent dataset.
