# Libraries for Data Science

 - Libraries are a collection of functions and methods that allow you to perform many actions without writing the code;
 - Python libraries are:
    - **Scientific Computing Libraries**
        - Pandas offers data structures and tools for effective data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis;
        - Numpy is based on arrays and matrices allowing the user to apply mathematical functions to the arrays.
    - **Visualization Libraries**
        - Matplotlib is the most well-known library for data visualization because it is allows the creating graphs and plots;
        - Seaborn, based on Matplotlib, can generate heatmaps, time series, and other advanced graphs.
    - **Machine Learning**
        - Scikit-learn containes tools for statistical modeling, including regression, classification, clustering, etc;
        - Keras allows users to build standard deep learning models;
        - Tensorflow is another framework that can be used to build deep learning models for production and deployment;
        - Pytorch is used for experimentation, making it simple for researchers to test ideas.
    
# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

 - An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other;
 - Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs, allow users to communicate through the Internet, enabling the use of resources like storage, data, and artificial intelligent algorithms;
 - A REST API works by using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources identified by URLs;
 - It follows principles like statelessness, client-server separation, and cacheability to ensure efficient and scalable communication between clients and servers.

# Datasets

 - A dataset is a structured collection of data represented as text, numbers, or media such as images, audio, or video files;
 - Popular datasets structures are:
    - A tabular dataset comprises a collection of rows containing columns that store the information;
    - Hierarchical datasets usually organized in a tree-like format;
    - Network data, which is stored as a graph.
 - You can find a comprehensive list of available datasets on:
    - The Open Knowledge Foundation’s website, that aims to be the most comprehensive list of open data catalogs in the world;
    - Kaggle, a popular data science online community, you can find (and contribute) datasets that might be of general interes;
    - Data repositories maintained by the United Nations, the European Union, and many other governmental and intergovernmental organizations.
 - Open data has played a significant role in the growth of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence;
 - Two licenses were initially created for sharing data: 
    - The CDLA-Sharing license grants you permission to use and modify the data. But if you publish your modified version of the data, you must do so under the same license terms as the original data;
    - The CDLA-Permissive license also grants you permission to use and modify the data. However, you are not required to share changes to the data​

# Data Asset eXchange (DAX)

 - Provides a trusted source for finding open datasets that are ready for use in enterprise applications;
 - DAX also provides tutorials in the form of notebooks that walk through the basics of data cleaning, pre-processing, and exploratory analysis.
 
# Machine Learning Models

 - Machine Learning (ML) models identify patterns in data;
 - Model training is the process by which the model learns the data patterns;
 - After a model is trained it can be used to make predictions;
 - ML models can be divided into three categories: supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning.

**Supervised Learning**

 - The supervised learning models identifies relationships and dependencies between the input data and the correct output;
 - The most of commom types of supervised learning are:
    - Regression, which are algorithms that are able to predict real numerical values. For example, home sales prices, stock market prices, etc;
    - Classification, which are algorithms that are able to classify data into categories. For example, email spam filters, fraud detection, image classification, etc.

**Unsupervised Learning**

 - Data is not labeled;
 - Model tries to identify patterns without external help;
 - The most of commom types of unsupervised learning are:
    - Clustering, which divides each record of a dataset into one of similar group.

**Deep Learning**

 - Tries to loosely emulate how the human brain works;
 - It's applications are:
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP);
    - Image, audio, and video analysis;
    - Time series forecasting.
 - Requires large datasets of labeled datas and is compute intensive;

# The Model Asset eXchange

A free open source resource for deep learning models. To reduce time to value, consider taking advantage of pre-trained models for certain types of problems. These pre-trained models can be ready to use right away, or they might take less time to train.

# Summary

 - Python offers a diverse library ecosystem for data science, covering scientific computing (Pandas, NumPy), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and high-level machine learning (Scikit-learn);
 - Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate communication between software components;
 - Machine learning models analyze data and identify patterns to make predictions and automate complex tasks;
 - The Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) facilitates open data sharing by providing clear licensing terms for distribution and use;
 - The Model Asset eXchange (MAX) provides a wealth of pre-trained deep learning models, empowering developers with readily deployable solutions for various business challenges.
