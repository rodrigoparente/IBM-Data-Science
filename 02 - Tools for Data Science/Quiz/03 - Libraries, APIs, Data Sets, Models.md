1. Which library is used for machine learning? 

- [x] Scikit-learn
- [ ] Pandas
- [ ] Matplotlib
- [ ] NumPy

**Correct**  
Correct. For machine learning, the Scikit-learn library contains tools for statistical modeling, including regression, classification, clustering, and so on.

2. What is the main purpose of an Application Programming Interface (API)?  

- [x] Allow communication between software components
- [ ] Facilitate communication between hardware components
- [ ] Create graphical representations of data
- [ ] Design user interfaces for applications

**Correct**  
Correct. An API allows communication between software components.

3. In a REST API architecture, what does the client typically receive from the web service after sending a request? 

- [ ] HTML file
- [ ] Binary data
- [ ] XML document
- [x] JSON file

**Correct**  
Correct. In a REST API, the client usually receives a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file as a response from the web service after sending a request.

4. What term is used to describe a structured collection of data?  

- [ ] Data Format
- [x] Data Set
- [ ] Data Grid
- [ ] Data Store

**Correct**  
Correct. A data set is a structured collection of data. 

5. What type of resources are available for developers on the Data Asset eXchange (DAX) platform?  

- [ ] Only proprietary data sets with restricted access
- [ ] Only pre-trained machine learning models
- [x] Curated collections of open data sets along with tutorial notebooks
- [ ] Only raw data files without any associated documentation

**Correct**  
Correct. The Data Asset eXchange (DAX) platform provides curated collections of open data sets and tutorial notebooks.

6. What is the primary task of model training in machine learning?  

- [x] Identifying patterns in the data
- [ ] Preparing the data
- [ ] Making predictions
- [ ] Evaluating the model

**Correct**  
Correct. The primary task of model training in machine learning is to identify patterns in the data that can be used to make predictions or decisions. During training, the model learns from the input data and adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.

7. Which type of machine learning model is primarily used to predict a numeric value?  

- [ ] Clustering
- [ ] Classification
- [x] Regression
- [ ] Reinforcement

**Correct**  
Correct. The regression models are used to predict numeric values.

8. Which of the following statements are true regarding deep learning models based on the information provided in the video? 

- [x] Deep learning models emulate how the human brain solves problems.
- [ ] Deep learning models do not require specialized hardware for training.
- [ ] Deep learning models are only used for natural language processing tasks.
- [ ] Deep learning models require small data sets for training.

**Correct**  
Correct. Deep learning is a specialized type of machine learning. It refers to a general set of models and techniques that loosely emulate how the human brain solves various problems.

9. Which of the following domains are covered by models available on the Model Asset eXchange?  

- [x] Object detection, image classification, audio processing, and more
- [ ] Only object detection
- [ ] Text classification and natural language processing only
- [ ] Only image classification

**Correct**  
Correct. MAX provides models for various domains covering many applications, including object detection, image classification, audio processing, and more.

10.  What tool is used to edit front-end languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in the context of exploring machine learning models?  

- [x] CodePen
- [ ] Red Hat OpenShift
- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] IBM Cloud

**Correct**  
Correct. CodePen is a tool used to edit front-end languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in the context of exploring machine learning models.
