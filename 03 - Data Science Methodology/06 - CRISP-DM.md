# Introduction to CRISP-DM

 - CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts;
 - CRISP-DM is an iterative data mining mode and is a comprehensive methodology for data mining projects which provides a structured approach to guide data-driven decision making;
 - As a data methodology, a study of the CRISP-DM model includes six data mining stages, their descriptions and provides explanations of the relationships between tasks and stages;
 - And as a process model, CRISP-DM provides high-level insights into the data mining cycle;
 - The 6 stages of CRISP-DM are: 
    - **Business Understanding:** which focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective. It involves defining the problem, setting goals, and determining the success criteria;
    - **Data Understanding:** in this stage, data is collected and explored to understand its characteristics. This includes identifying data quality issues, discovering initial insights, and detecting interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information;
    - **Data Preparation:** this phase involves preparing the final dataset that will be used for modeling. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and selection of relevant features;
    - **Modeling:** during this stage, various modeling techniques are selected and applied to the prepared data. Different models are built and their parameters are calibrated to optimize performance;
    - **Evaluation:** the models are thoroughly evaluated to ensure they meet the business objectives. This involves assessing the model's accuracy and validity, and determining whether it sufficiently addresses the business problem;
    - **Deployment:** the final phase involves deploying the model into the operational environment. This can include generating reports, implementing a repeatable data mining process, or integrating the model into a business application.
