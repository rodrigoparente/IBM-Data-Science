1. Which of the following options is essential for ensuring the relevance and usefulness of the answer derived from a data science model?

- [x] Familiarity of stakeholders with the tool produced
- [ ] The number of stakeholders involved
- [ ] The availability of data
- [ ] The complexity of the model

**Correct**  
Correct! The key obtaining making the answer relevant and useful that addresses the initial business question involves getting the stakeholders familiar with the tool produced.

2. In a business scenario, who are the stakeholders that help make the model’s answer relevant?

- [ ] Data scientists and statisticians.
- [ ] Cognos application developers.
- [ ] Hospital staff and patients.
- [x] Solution owners, marketing, application developers, and IT administration.

**Correct**  
Correct! In a business scenario, stakeholders have different specialties to help make this happen, such as the solution owner, marketing, application developers, and IT administration.

3. Which of the following statements describes how data scientists refine the model after the initial deployment and feedback stages?

- [x] By incorporating information about participation and possibly refining with detailed pharmaceutical data.
- [ ] By automating the intervention program.
- [ ] By conducting a complete overhaul of the model.
- [ ] By collecting more data from controlled groups.

**Correct**  
Correct! Other refinements included incorporating information about participation in the intervention program and possibly refining the model to incorporate detailed pharmaceutical data. 

4. How does the data science methodology ensure continuous improvement?

- [ ] By only relying on expert opinions
- [x] By incorporating feedback and making adjustments
- [ ] By making the methodology linear and rigid
- [ ] By automating the entire process

**Correct**  
Correct. Making the methodology cyclical ensures refinement at each stage in the game.

5. What is the primary purpose of storytelling in data science?

- [ ] To highlight personal achievements
- [x] To communicate complex findings and insights effectively
- [ ] To showcase programming skills
- [ ] To impress colleagues with technical jargon

**Correct**  
Storytelling helps to communicate insights and results effectively to non-technical stakeholders. Storytelling is crucial to data and analytics. Storytelling is how you convey your message. Everyone can show numbers, but if you don’t have a story and if you don’t have a compelling reason to act, then, ultimately, what you’re presenting will not resonate with your audience.
