# Introduction to Python

 - Python is the most popular programming language in the data science industry, with 75% of over 10,000 respondents using it regularly, according to a 2019 Kaggle survey;
 - Glassdoor reported in 2019, that over 75% of data science job listings included Python as a required skill;
 - Python is versatile, used in data science, artificial intelligence, web development, and Internet of things, with support from a large global community and the Python Software Foundation;
 - For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib;
 - For artificial intelligence, it has TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Scikit-learn;
 - Major organizations like IBM, Google, NASA, and Facebook use Python, which has a comprehensive standard library for various tasks including machine learning and data analytics.

# Types

 - Python supports different data types: integers, real numbers (floats), and strings (words);
 - Integers can be positive or negative and have a large but finite range;
 - Floats are real numbers, including those between integers, with a very small limit;
 - Typecasting allows conversion between data types, such as int to float or string to int;
 - Converting a float to an int can result in loss of information, and converting non-integer strings to int causes errors;
 - Boolean is another important type in Python, with values True and False;
 - Casting Boolean True to an integer or float results in 1, and False results in 0.

# Expressions and Variables

 - Expressions describe operations that computers perform, such as basic arithmetic;
 - Operands are the numbers involved, and operators are the symbols (e.g., +, -, *);
 - Python can perform subtraction, multiplication, and division, with results like 5.0 and approximately 4.167;
 - Integer division uses double slashes (//) and rounds the result;
 - Python follows mathematical conventions, performing operations in parentheses first, then multiplication, and finally addition;
 - Variables store values using the assignment operator (e.g., `my_variable = 1`);
 - Variables can be reassigned new values, and the old value becomes irrelevant;
 - Results of expressions can be stored in variables and used in further operations;
 - Meaningful variable names help keep track of their purpose (e.g., `total_min` for total minutes);
 - Modifying a variable's value updates dependent results without changing the rest of the code.

# String Operations

 - A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, which can be spaces, digits, or special characters;
 - Strings can be assigned to variables and accessed using indices, including negative indexing;
 - Strings can be treated as sequences, allowing operations like slicing and using stride values;
 - The `len` command returns the length of a string;
 - Strings can be concatenated using the addition symbol and replicated by multiplying the string;
 - Strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed, but new strings can be created by concatenation;
 - Backslashes start escape sequences, like `\n` for a new line and `\t` for a tab;
 - Use a double backslash to include a backslash in a string;
 - String methods include those that work on lists/tuples and those specific to strings;
 - The `upper` method converts all characters in a string to uppercase;
 - The `replace` method changes a substring within a string, and the `find` method locates the first index of a substring, returning -1 if not found.

# Summary

 - Python distinguishes among data types: integers, floats, strings, and Booleans;
 - Expressions combine values and operations, following the order of operations;
 - Variables store and manipulate data, with reassignment overriding previous values;
 - String operations include indexing, concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
