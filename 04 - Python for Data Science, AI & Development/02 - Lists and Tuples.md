# Lists and Tuples

 - Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation;
 - Tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be changed once defined;
 - Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples use parentheses `()`;
 - Lists are generally slower than tuples due to their mutable nature;
 - Both lists and tuples can contain elements of different data types;
 - Lists have more built-in methods compared to tuples;
 - Tuples are often used for fixed collections of items, while lists are used for collections that may change;
 - Lists and tuples can be nested within each other to create complex data structures.

# Dictionaries

 - Python dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique;
 - Keys in dictionaries must be immutable types like strings, numbers, or tuples;
 - Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for changes to their values after creation;
 - They are defined using curly braces `{}`, with key-value pairs separated by colons;
 - Dictionary elements are accessed via their keys, not by index.

# Sets

 - Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, meaning no duplicates are allowed;
 - They are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function;
 - Sets support operations like union, intersection, and difference;
 - Elements in a set must be immutable types, such as strings, numbers, or tuples;
 - Sets are mutable, allowing for the addition and removal of elements.

# Summary

 - Tuples are ordered and immutable collections, written as comma-separated elements in parentheses `()`;
 - Lists are mutable, ordered collections, represented with square brackets `[]`, and can hold elements of different types;
 - Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, using curly brackets `{}`, with keys being unique and immutable;
 - Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, defined using curly brackets `{}`, and support operations like union and intersection.
