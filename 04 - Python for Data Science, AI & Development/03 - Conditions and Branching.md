# Conditions and Branching

 - Conditions in Python are used to execute code only if a certain condition is met, typically using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements;
 - The `if` statement checks a condition and executes the indented block of code if the condition is true;
 - The `elif` statement allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially after an initial `if` statement;
 - The `else` statement provides a block of code that executes if none of the preceding conditions are true;
 - Logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` can be used to combine multiple conditions within a single `if` statement.

# Loops

 - For loops iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each element;
 - While loops continue to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true;
 - `break` exits the loop entirely, while `continue` skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next;
 - The `range()` function is often used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers;
 - Nested loops allow for complex iteration patterns by placing one loop inside another.

# Functions

 - Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses `()`;
 - They can take arguments (parameters) to process data and return results using the `return` statement;
 - Functions help in organizing code into reusable blocks, making it more modular and readable;
 - You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments;
 - Functions can have default parameter values, allowing them to be called with fewer arguments than defined.

# Exception Handling

 - Exceptions in Python are errors detected during execution, which can be handled using `try` and `except` blocks;
 - The `try` block contains code that might raise an exception, while the `except` block handles the exception if it occurs;
 - The `finally` block, if present, executes code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not;
 - The `else` block, if present, runs code only if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block;
 - Custom exceptions can be created by defining new exception classes that inherit from the built-in `Exception` class.

# Objects and Classes

 - Objects are instances of classes, encapsulating data (attributes) and behavior (methods);
 - Classes are blueprints for creating objects, defined using the `class` keyword;
 - Methods within a class are functions that define the behaviors of an object;
 - The `__init__` method initializes an object's attributes when an instance is created;
 - Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

# Summary

 - Branching directs program flow using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to execute different code blocks based on conditions;
 - Loops automate repetitive tasks and iterate over data structures, with `for` loops iterating over sequences and `while` loops executing as long as a condition is true;
 - Functions are reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks, take input parameters, and often return results, enhancing code modularity and reusability;
 - Exception handling manages errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to prevent program crashes.
