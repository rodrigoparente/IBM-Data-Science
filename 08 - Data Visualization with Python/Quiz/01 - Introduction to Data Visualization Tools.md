1. Who was the creator of Matplotlib?

- [ ] James Gosling, a Canadian computer scientist
- [ ] Daniel Johnson, a German physicist
- [x] John Hunter, an American neurobiologist
- [ ] Cleve Moler, an American mathematician and computer programmer

**Correct**
Correct! The creator of Matplotlib was John Hunter, an American neurobiologist.

2. True or False. Using the inline backend, you cannot modify a figure after it is rendered.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Correct**
Correct! One limitation of this backend is that you cannot modify a figure once it’s rendered. So, after rendering the figure, we cannot add, for example, a figure title or labels to its axes.

3. Using Matplotlib magic functions which code starts the command?

- [x] `%matplotlib`
- [ ] `%matplotlib inline`
- [ ] `$matplotlib outline`
- [ ] `%matplotlib notebook`

**Correct**
Correct! The command starts with "%matplotlib," and notebook is one of the Matplotlib backends. A sign of a magic function is that it starts with "%matplotlib.”

4. What does a line plot display?

- [ ] A line plot is used to display information on pie charts
- [ ] A plot that displays line fragments at different data points
- [ ] A line plot displays information through bars on a chart
- [x] Information as a series of data points connected by straight lines.

**Correct**
Correct! Line plots display information as a series of data points connected by straight lines.

5. Which of the following is not a main layer of Matplotlib.

- [x] Histogram
- [ ] Scripting
- [ ] Backend
- [ ] Artist

   **Answer:** Histogram

6. What is Jupyter Notebook used for?

- [ ] A Python library with a number of different backends available
- [ ] It is a tool used for creating conventional visualization tools using the plot function
- [x] An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations, and some explanatory text as well
- [ ] A well-established data visualization library that can be integrated into different environments

**Correct**
Correct! Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations, and some explanatory text as well.

7. Matplotlib was initially developed as an _____ and _____ visualization tool. Select two.

- [x] ECoG

**Correct**
Correct! Matplotlib was initially developed as an ECoG visualization tool.

- [ ] ECG
- [x] EEG

**Correct**
Correct! Matplotlib was initially developed as an EEG visualization tool.

- [ ] EG

8. True or False. The backend layers three built-in interface classes are FigureCanvas, Renderer, and Event.

- [ ] False
- [x] True

   **Answer:** True

9. True or False. Line plots capture trends and changes over time, allowing us to see patterns and fluctuations.

- [ ] False
- [x] True

   **Answer:** True

10.  Which of the following plots is not ideal for comparing different categories or groups? Select all that apply.

- [x] Scatter plots
- [ ] Pie plots
- [ ] Bar plots
- [x] Line plots

    **Answer:** Scatter plots, Line plots

11. Complete the following. Matplotlib’s three main layers are:

- [x] Backend, Artist, Scripting
- [ ] Artist, Scripting, Histogram
- [ ] Line2D, Rectangle, Circle
- [ ] FigureCanvas, Renderer, Event

**Correct**
Correct! Matplotlib’s three main layers are Backend Layer, Artist Layer, and Scripting Layer.

12. True or False: Line plots can be misleading if the scales on the axes are not carefully chosen to reflect the data accurately.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Correct**
Correct! Line plots can be misleading if the scales on the axes are not carefully chosen to reflect the data accurately. Line plots capture trends and changes over time, allowing us to see patterns and fluctuations.

10. True or False. Bar plots are ideal for comparing different categories or groups.

- [ ] False
- [x] True

**Correct**
Correct. Bar plots are ideal for comparing different categories or groups.
