1. A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays values pertaining to typically how many variables?

- [ ] Three
- [x] Two
- [ ] Four
- [ ] One

**Correct!**
Correct. A scatter plot displays values pertaining to typically two variables against each other. Usually, it is a dependent variable that is plotted against an independent variable to determine if any correlation between the two variables exists.

2. True or False. When plotting directly with Matplotlib, the pyplot module offers a convenient way to create and customize plots quickly.

- [ ] False
- [x] True

**Correct!**
Correct. Matplotlib is a general-purpose comprehensive plotting library. Its pyplot module offers a convenient way to create and customize plots quickly.

3. True or False. A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, divided into segments to illustrate numerical proportion.

- [ ] False
- [x] True 

**Correct!**
Correct. A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, divided into segments, to illustrate numerical proportions.

4. How many primary dimensions does a box plot utilize to statistically represent the distribution of a given data?

- [ ] 4
- [x] 5
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 1

**Correct!**
Correct. A box plot is a way of statistically representing the distribution of given data through five primary dimensions. These include Minimum, First quartile, Median, Third quartile, and Maximum.

5. Area plots are similar to what other type of plot?

- [ ] Bar
- [ ] Area
- [ ] Box
- [x] Line

**Correct!**
Correct. An area plot, also known as an area chart or graph, displays the magnitude and proportion of multiple variables over a continuous axis, typically representing time or another ordered dimension.

6. In the above chart, what do the letters in the box plot represent?

- [ ] A = Mean, B = Third Quartile, C = First Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Maximum
- [ ] A = Mean, B = Upper Mean Quartile, C = Lower Mean Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Outliers
- [x] A = Median, B = Third Quartile, C = First Quartile, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Minimum, and F = Outliers
- [ ] A = Median, B = Third Quartile, C = Mean, D = Inter Quartile Range, E = Lower Quartile, and F = Outliers

**Correct!**
Correct. The typical labels for a box plot include Median, Third Quartile, First Quartile, Inter Quartile Range, Minimum, and Outliers.

7. True or False. The correct combination of function and parameter to create a box plot in Matplotlib is Function = plot, and Parameter = kind with value = "box".

- [ ] True
- [x] False

**Correct!**
Correct. To create a box plot in Matplotlib, the function `boxplot()` is used, not `plot()`. The `kind="box"` parameter is not correct.

8. True or False. The first step when creating a histogram in matplotlib is to import matplotlib as mpl and its scripting interface as plt.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

**Correct!**
Correct. The typical first step is to import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, not `matplotlib` as `mpl`.

9. True or False. The process of creating a scatter plot involves importing Matplotlib to visualize a large set of data.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Correct!**
Correct. A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays values pertaining to typically two variables against each other. The process of creating a scatter plot involves importing Matplotlib to visualize the data.

10.  True or False. A bar chart is also known as a Bar graph.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Correct!**
Correct. Unlike a histogram, a bar chart, also known as a bar graph, is a type of plot where the length of each bar is proportional to the value of the item that it represents.
