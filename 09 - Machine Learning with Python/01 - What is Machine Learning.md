# What is Machine Learning?

 - Machine Learning (ML) is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to **learn and improve from experience without explicit programming**;
 - In other words, ML focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn autonomously.

# Traditional Approach vs. Machine Learning

Considering the classification of animals in images:

 - In a **traditional approach**, we would transform the images into feature vectors and write explicit rules to detect animals;
 - However, this approach was cumbersome, dataset-dependent, and lacked generalization;
 - The **machine learning** allows us to build models that learn patterns from feature sets without explicit programming.

## Real-Life Applications

 - **Recommendation Systems:** Netflix and Amazon use ML to suggest videos, movies, and TV shows based on user preferences;
 - **Healthcare Personalization:** ML assists in predicting disease risk, personalizing treatment plans, and analyzing medical images;
 - **Self-Driving Cars:** Waymo's vehicles rely on ML sensors to navigate real-time environments, making decisions based on surroundings;
 - **Social Media Personalization:** ML algorithms analyze user behavior to personalize content, recommend friends, and tailor ads on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

# Popular ML Techniques

   - **Regression:** predict continuous values (e.g., house prices, CO2 emissions);
   - **Classification:** predict categories (e.g., benign/malignant cells, customer churn);
   - **Clustering:** group similar cases (e.g., patient segmentation);
   - **Anomaly Detection:** identify abnormal cases (e.g., credit card fraud);
   - **Dimension Reduction:** reduce data size;
   - **Recommendation Systems:** match preferences and recommend items (books, movies).

# AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
  
   - **AI:** aims to make computers intelligent, mimicking human cognitive functions.
   - **Machine Learning:** subset of AI where computers learn from data without explicit programming.
   - **Deep Learning:** a specific ML technique using neural networks for complex tasks.

# Python Libraries for Machine Learning

 - **NumPy:** scientific library for handling large datasets, linear algebra, and mathematical operations;
 - **SciPy:** builds upon NumPy, providing additional scientific and statistical functionality.
 - **Matplotlib:** allows the creation of 2D and 3D charts and plots from data;
 - **pandas:** provides tools and data structures for efficient data manipulation and analysis;
 - **scikit-learn:** is a powerful machine learning library with a wide range of algorithms implemented.

# Supervised vs Unsupervised

 - **Supervised Learning:** uses **labeled data** to predict outcomes or classify data accurately;
 - **Examples**:
    - **Classification**: Assigning test data to specific categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails);
    - **Regression**: Understanding relationships between dependent and independent variables (e.g., sales revenue projections).

 - **Unsupervised Learning:** analyzes **unlabeled data** to discover hidden patterns without human intervention;
 - **Examples**:
    - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points based on similarities or differences (e.g., market segmentation);
    - **Association**: Identifying relationships between data points (e.g., frequent itemsets);
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying data representation (e.g., reducing features).
