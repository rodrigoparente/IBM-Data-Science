1. Which option lists the steps of training a logistic regression model in the correct order?

- [ ] 3, 2, 5, 4, 1
- [x] 4, 1, 3, 2, 5
- [ ] 1, 4, 3, 2, 5
- [ ] 4, 3, 2, 5, 1

2. What is the objective of SVM in terms of hyperplanes?

- [ ] Minimize the distance between hyperplane and the support vectors.
- [x] Choose the hyperplane that represents the largest margin between the two classes.
- [ ] Find the hyperplane of the lowest dimension.
- [ ] Choose the hyperplane that’s closest to one of the two classes.

3. Logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a:

- [x] Categorical dependent variable
- [ ] Numerical independent variable
- [ ] Numerical dependent variable
- [ ] Categorical independent variable

4. In which cases would we want to consider using SVM?

- [ ] When we want multiple decision boundaries with varying weights.
- [ ] When we desire efficiency when using large datasets.
- [x] When mapping the data to a higher dimensional feature space can better separate classes.
- [ ] When we desire probability estimates for each class.

5. What is a disadvantage of one-vs-all classification?

- [ ] It cannot output probability estimates of classes.
- [ ] It requires more models to be created compared to one-vs-one.
- [x] There’s an ambiguous region where multiple classes are valid outputs.
- [ ] It does not handle two-class classification well.
