1. The objective of k-means clustering is:

- [ ] Yield the highest out of sample accuracy
- [x] Separate dissimilar samples and group similar ones
- [ ] Minimize the cost function via gradient descent
- [ ] Maximize the number of correctly classified data points

2. Which option correctly orders the steps of k-means clustering?

- [x] 2, 5, 3, 1, 4
- [ ] 2, 1, 4, 5, 3
- [ ] 2, 3, 4, 5, 1
- [ ] 3, 5, 1, 4, 2

3. How can we gauge the performance of a k-means clustering model when ground truth is not available?

- [ ] Determine the prediction accuracy on the test set.
- [x] Take the average of the distance between data points and their cluster centroids.
- [ ] Calculate the number of incorrectly classified observations in the training set.
- [ ] Calculate the R-squared value to measure model fit.

4. When the parameter K for k-means clustering increases, what happens to the error?

- [ ] It will decrease because the data points are less possible to be in the wrong cluster.
- [x] It will decrease because distance between data points and centroid will decrease.
- [ ] It will increase because incorrectly classified points are further from the correct centroid.
- [ ] It might increase or decrease depending on if data points are closer to the centroid.

5. Which of the following is true for partition-based clustering but not hierarchical nor density-based clustering algorithms?

- [x] Partition-based clustering produces sphere-like clusters.
- [ ] Partition-based clustering can handle spatial clusters and noisy data.
- [ ] Partition-based clustering produces arbitrary shaped clusters.
- [ ] Partition-based clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm.
