# Project Overview

 - Companies like *Virgin Galactic*, *Blue Origin*, and *SpaceX* are making space travel affordable;
 - *SpaceX* reduced the launch cost of rockets from $165 million to $62 million;
 - The savings were due to the reuse of the first stage;
 - However, it is not always possible to save the first stage;
 - As a data scientist for a new rocket company called SpaceY, you need to:
    - Gather information about SpaceX;
    - Create dashboards for your team;
    - Predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage using machine learning models.
