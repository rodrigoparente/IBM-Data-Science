# Exploratory Data Analysis Overview

 - Determine attributes correlated with successful landings;
 - Convert categorical variables using one hot encoding;
 - Prepare data for a machine learning model to predict first stage landing success.

**Lab 1**

 - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using a database.

**Lab 2**

 - Determine if the data can predict the Falcon 9â€™s first stage landing;
 - Use attributes to predict if the first stage can be reused with machine learning.
