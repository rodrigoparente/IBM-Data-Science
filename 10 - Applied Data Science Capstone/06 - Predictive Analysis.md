# Predictive Analysis

 - we will build a machine learning pipeline to predict the successful landing of the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket;
 - The pipeline will involve the following steps:

**Preprocessing**

 - Standardizing the data to ensure consistent scaling.

**Train-Test Split**

 - Dividing the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

**Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**

 - Training the model using various algorithms;
 - Performing Grid Search to identify the optimal hyperparameters for each algorithm.

**Model Evaluation**

 - Using the best hyperparameter values to determine the model with the highest accuracy on the training data.

**Algorithms to Test**

 - Logistic Regression;
 - Support Vector Machines (SVM);
 - Decision Tree Classifier;
 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

**Confusion Matrix**

 - Generating and outputting the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the best model.
