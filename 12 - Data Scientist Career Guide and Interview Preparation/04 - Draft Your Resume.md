# Tips of Drafting Your Resume

Here are key detailed tips for crafting an effective resume:

**Length and Formatting**

 - Keep your resume concise. Ideally, one page is best, but two pages are acceptable if you have significant relevant experience;
 - Use bulleted lists for clarity, ensuring bullets are concise yet informative;
 - Maintain consistent tense: use the present tense for your current role and past tense for previous roles;
 - Double-check spelling, grammar, and contact information, and use a professional email address.

**Work Experience**

 - The work experience section is typically the most substantial part of your resume. Depending on your preference, it can precede or follow a projects section;
 - Follow a structured approach when detailing your work experience: start with an action word, describe the task, and quantify the result if possible (e.g., "Deployed improved database design, which increased efficiency by 25%");
 - Common action words include initiated, constructed, converted, deployed, led, and designed.

**Projects Section**

 - For those new to the job market, a Projects section can be valuable, showcasing relevant work that might not fit traditional job roles;
 - As you gain more professional experience, this section may become less necessary.

**Skills Section**

 - Include a dedicated Skills section to emphasize technical abilities that may not be obvious from job descriptions;
 - List relevant technical skills, software, and tools. Tailor this list for each job application by removing irrelevant skills and potentially adding a few that help you stand out;
 - Depending on the template, the skills section can be a simple list or include a graphical representation of your mastery in each area.

**Education Section**

 - Highlight your educational background, using the format: Degree Type and Major, University Name, Year Graduated, and optionally, GPA and honors;
 - Emphasize education if you have recently graduated or if it's particularly relevant to the job.

**Hobbies and Interests**

 - Include hobbies or interests only if they are relevant to the job or if you have limited professional experience;
 - Avoid adding them if you have substantial experience, as they can be distracting.

**Additional Sections**

 - Depending on relevance, you may include sections for conferences, publications, awards, and technical training or certifications;
 - Avoid including sections that don't add value to your application.

**Communication and Presentation**

 - Strong communication and presentation skills are essential in data science, complementing your technical abilities;
 - While visually attractive resumes are easier to create with modern templates, prioritize content relevance and clarity.

**ATS-Friendly Resume**

 - Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to sort through resumes, so it's vital to make your resume ATS-friendly;
 - Avoid complex layouts with multiple columns, images, or creative designs, as ATS software may not read them correctly;
 - Use industry-standard terms and keywords aligned with job postings. Keywords should be naturally integrated into your resume, not randomly inserted;
 - Organize information for easy scanning, with clear section headers and concise descriptions;
 - Ensure contact information is prominently displayed at the top of the page.

**SEO and Online Searchability**

 - Incorporate Search Engine Optimization (SEO) principles into your resume to enhance its online visibility;
 - Use purposeful keywords in context, keep up with emerging industry terminology, and provide relevant, working links;
 - If you include links to social media profiles, ensure they present a professional image;
 - Avoid large image files in your resume or portfolio, and add alt-text to any images or graphs to improve accessibility and keyword integration.

**Resume Formats**

 - ATS software works best with Microsoft Word documents, so always have a Word version of your resume ready;
 - You may also provide alternate formats, such as plain text, Braille, PDF, or in different languages, depending on the job requirements or company preferences.

# Tips From Experts

Tips provided by experts on creating resumes and cover letters that stand out for data science positions:

 1. **Personalization:** Tailor both your resume and cover letter to the specific job you’re applying for. Highlight the skills and attributes mentioned in the job description. Avoid generic cover letters, which can be a major turn-off for employers.
 2. **Resume Basics:** Ensure your resume is error-free, well-organized, and includes your name. Use tools like LinkedIn and Microsoft Word templates to create a professional-looking resume. Depending on the role, consider adding creative elements if relevant, but avoid overdoing it.
 3. **First Impressions:** Your resume should clearly communicate who you are, what you do, and why you’re a good fit for the role. It should serve as a good profile of your background and experience, aligning with your LinkedIn profile.
 4. **Relevant Experience:** Focus on your practical experience rather than just the number of years worked. If you’re new to the field, gain experience through hackathons, internships, Kaggle competitions, personal projects, and publishing your work online (e.g., blogs, GitHub, YouTube).
 5. **Cover Letter Tips:** Address specific requirements from the job description in your cover letter. If you lack certain experience, explain how you plan to gain it.
 6. **Conciseness:** A one-page resume is the gold standard, as longer resumes may be disregarded. Ensure that the content is concise and directly relevant to the job you’re applying for.
 7. **Multiple Resumes:** Tailor your resume to each job, possibly creating different versions for different types of roles. For instance, emphasize communication and data visualization for a business data science role, and programming and statistical skills for a machine learning position.
 8. **Key Skills:** Data science job seekers should have strong foundations in mathematics, statistics, and programming (especially in Python and SQL). Certifications, internships, and participation in relevant events like meetups and hackathons are also valuable.
 9. **Education and Practical Application:** Build a solid theoretical foundation through university courses or MOOCs, then apply this knowledge by replicating research papers, participating in competitions, and seeking hands-on experience through internships or projects.
