# Company and Industry Research in Data Science

When preparing for a job interview, the first crucial step is to thoroughly research the organization and the industry. The company's website is a valuable resource, offering specific sections that can provide insightful information:

 1. **History**: Explore the company's origins, mission, and vision statements to understand its goals and culture;
 2. **Keywords**: Identify recurring terms on the website, as they reflect how the company presents itself. Using similar language in your interview can demonstrate alignment with the company’s values;
 3. **Careers**: Review other job listings to gauge where the company is focusing its growth, which can hint at its strategic priorities;
 4. **Data**: As a data scientist, focus on quantitative data like sales reports, customer numbers, and project achievements. This information might reveal the tools and methodologies the company employs.

Beyond the company’s website, several additional sources can enhance your understanding:

 - **Chamber of Commerce and Better Business Bureau**: These websites can offer official insights into the company’s reputation and standing in the business community; 
 - **Social Media**: Check platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter for current news, company culture insights, and employee experiences;
 - **Web Searches**: Look for any recent media coverage or articles about the company that could provide context or reveal issues worth considering;
 - **LinkedIn**: Research your interviewer's professional background if their name is known, and explore the company’s presence for more details;
 - **Glassdoor**: Read employee reviews and interview reports to get an insider’s view of the company and potential interview formats.

Additionally, consider conducting **informational interviews**. These are informal conversations with professionals in your field of interest, aimed at gathering career insights rather than securing a job. 

To set up an informational interview:

1. Identify three to five companies you’re interested in;
2. Use LinkedIn or other networks to find professionals in roles you aspire to, like data scientists;
3. Reach out via email, phone, or social media with a brief introduction and a request for a meeting;
4. During the interview, let the conversation flow naturally, take notes, and be mindful of the agreed time limit.

After the interview, review your notes, highlight key points for further research, and send a thank-you note to the interviewee. Stay connected on LinkedIn to grow your professional network.

When preparing questions for these interviews, consider asking about:

 - The interviewee’s career journey (e.g., how they became interested in data science);
 - Their current role (e.g., what a typical day looks like, favorite projects, challenges);
 - Career advice (e.g., related fields to explore, ways to stay updated on technology, job search strategies).

Overall, conducting thorough research and engaging in informational interviews will equip you with the knowledge and confidence to excel in your job interview, helping you stand out as a well-prepared candidate.
