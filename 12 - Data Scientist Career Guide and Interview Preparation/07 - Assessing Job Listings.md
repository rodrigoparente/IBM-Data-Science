# Structure of Job Listings

Job listings typically include several key sections:

 1. **Overview of the Company and Role:** This section provides a general description of the job position and the hiring organization; 
 2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** Outlines the expected duties of the employee and details how they will fit into the organization;
 3. **Requirements and Qualifications:** Lists the desired candidate qualifications, including educational background, certifications, experience, and specific hard and soft skills. 
 
Ideally, candidates should meet all required qualifications and at least 50% of the preferred ones.

# Employment Types

**Full-Time (FTE)**

 - Indefinite employment with regular pay (salary or hourly);
 - Entitled to company benefits and incentives;
 - Subject to internal policies, trainings, and different legal rights regarding employment.

**Contract (Contingent)**
 - Employed for a specified duration with payment based on hours or deliverables;
 - Minimal training provided, as candidates are expected to possess necessary skills;
 - Generally do not receive company benefits and may be terminated without notice.

# Job Application Process

 - Pay close attention to application instructions in job postings, as each company may have specific submission requirements;
 - Applications may be submitted through company websites, emails, or direct contacts. Some employers may require cover letters, work samples, or skill assessments;
 - Ensure you fully understand the application process to avoid disqualification.

# Identifying Good Fit

 - Assess whether a company is a good fit for you by looking for potential warning flags in job listings, including:
    - **Lack of Clarity:** vague job titles or descriptions may indicate poor communication and unclear role expectations;
    - **Unrealistic Expectations:** listings that demand excessive qualifications for entry-level positions may signal a lack of understanding from the company or potential exploitation of new hires;
    - **Biases or Prejudice:** job listings that explicitly exclude certain groups based on personal traits should raise concerns.
