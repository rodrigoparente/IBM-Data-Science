# Negotiations
 
**Identify Non-Negotiables**

Before applying for a position, list your non-negotiables (e.g., salary, location, hours, flexibility, progression) to clarify what’s important to you.

**Engage in Conversations**

Discuss your priorities with recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers to ensure the position aligns with your expectations.

**Prepare to Sell Yourself**

Be ready to articulate your value and why you deserve your desired compensation. Prepare a compelling case to justify any counteroffer.

**Market Research**

Research salary ranges for the position and your current pay. Aim to negotiate for a salary that is 10-15% above your current income based on market data and the job's responsibilities.

**Negotiate Confidently**

It’s acceptable to negotiate offers. If the salary is low, express your concerns and inquire about the reasoning behind the offer.

**Counter Offer After Receiving an Offer**

Wait for the employer to make the first offer before countering, as it can be confrontational to propose a number first.

**Know Your Worth**

Don’t undervalue yourself. Research industry standards for the position based on your experience and skills. Determine your minimum acceptable salary and aim slightly higher in negotiations.

**Maintain Balance**

Consider flexibility, remote work, and job satisfaction. Aim for terms that support long-term employment and mutual benefit for both you and the employer.
